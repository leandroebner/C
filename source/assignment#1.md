# Assignment 1: Multiplication Table

Write a program that shows a multiplication table on the screen:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | . | . | . |
|---|---|---|----|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8  | . | . | . |
| 3 | 6 | 8 | 12 | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | .  | . | . | . |

First the program asks the user for the number of rows and the number of columns. Then the program shows the table on the screen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Write two versions of the program. One using a while-loop the other using a for-loop.

> [!TIP]
> Start with a program that shows just one line of variable length (depending on the input). Extend this program to show several lines.

> [!INFO]
> Basic documentation - only the mandatory parts of the documentation are required.
