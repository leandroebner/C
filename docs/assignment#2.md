# Assignment 2: ASCII-Table

Write a program that shows a table of the ASCII-Code ranging from 32 to 127. The table should show the character-representation of each number between 32 and 127 in four (double) rows.

| 32   | 56 8 | 80 P  | 104 h |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 33 ! | 57 9 | 81 Q  | 105 i |
| 34 " | 58 : | 82 R  | 106 j |
| 35 # | 59 ; | 83 S  | 107 k |
| 36 $ | 60 > | 84 T  | 108 l |
| .    | .    | .     | .     |
| .    | .    | .     | .     |
| 55 7 | 79 O | 103 g | 127   |

> [!TIP] 
> Use the same basic structure as in exercise 1. Calculate the value to show from the values of the index-variables. To print a character on the screen use %c as format element in the function ```printf("%c", . . . )```.

> [!NOTE] 
>Basic documentation plus program flowchart.
