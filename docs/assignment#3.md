# Assignment 3: Decimal To Binary Convertion

Write a program that converts an integer on to a binary numeral of 16 bits. The program reads in the integer an shows the corresponding binary numeral on the screen.

Use an array of length 16 for storing the binary numeral. Each entry has either the value 0 or 1. The first element of the array should hold the most significant bit of the binary numeral. The last element of the array should hold the least significant bit.

If the value of the integer does not fit into 16 Bits the program reports an error.

> [!TIP]
> The value of an integer is given as follows. Let $X$ be defined by the digits $z_n\ z_{(n-1)}\cdots z_1\ z_0$ with $z\in \{0,1,\cdots 9\}$. The value of $X$ is given by $X=\sum_{i=0}^{i=n}z_i*10^i$.
